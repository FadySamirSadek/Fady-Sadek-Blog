2017 was filled with events I can not say it was the best but it had its share of the good stuff.
I learned a lot of things in 2017 and I tried a lot of stuff which makes 2017 and my plan for 2018 is to stick to the things I enjoyed and 
benefited from the most and try to illuminate the things that were not as useful and fun.

1.Start blogging regularly
-------------------------
In 2016 and the early days of 2017 I had a [blog on medium]('https://medium.com/@fadysamirsadek') and I wrote a couple of blog posts there 
and I liked it a lot but after [medium](https://medium.com) was blocked in Egypt along with almost all major VPNs I stopped blogging.
To be honest it was completely my fault I could have used wordpress to setup a blog or GH pages like the blog I am writing this post on
right now . 

**The goal is to write at least one blog post every two weeks**


2.Contribute more to open source 
-------------------------
Unlike blogging which I did not do a lot in 2017 I contributed to some open source projects in 2017 and I was very active in the open source community but I plan to do it more frequently and focus my effort to be a maintainer to one of these projects.

Here are some of the projects that I contributed to in 2017:

1- [Angular Material 2](https://github.com/angular/material2)

2- [Chrome lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse)

3- [AMP project](https://github.com/ampproject)

**I learned ton of stuff contributing to these projects and I plan to do it more in 2018**

3.Redesign my own website
-------------------------
It is funny almost all the web designers and developers I know either have poorly designed websites or do not have at all which is kind of sarcastic . This is what I do full time I make websites and I do not have the time to build my own website which is crazy.
There is a project started by [the amazing jen simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons) that aims to encourage web designers and developers to build their own websites by posting or tweet about their plan and a deadline for them to publish their new website.

**My plan is to redesign and publish my own website by the end of February2018**

4.Help other people learn web development
----------------------------------------
I grew up in a very non technical family both my parents are teachers but I was very lucky to meet the people I met that helped me throughout
my career without these people I would have never reached the point I am in now and I plan to do the same for other people and give back to this awesome community.

**I do not have a clear plan of how I am going to do that yet but stay tuned ;)**

5.Become a better developer
--------------------------
I like to think that I am not a bad developer and a lot of the people that I have worked with in the past say that I am good but it amazed me when I recently watched a youtube video made by the amazing [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish) about [10 thing that he learned from the jQuery source code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_qE1iAmjFg) The amazing thing is that this video was uploaded to youtube more than 7 years ago and there were some things in the video I did not know about which made me happy that I learned these things but also sad that I have been doing web development for sometime know and I hope to be as good as Paul Irish one day but knowing that he is ahead of me more than 7 years is kind of frustrating but it made me want to learn more about javascript as a language itself before diving more into the frameworks and the stacks I use daily.

**I plan to watch more courses and read more books about Javascript as a language** 

6.Read more books
----------------
Everything that I learned about web development was either from a course that I watched online or from trying out different stuff. I did not learn a lot of stuff from books as I do not read a lot but the few books I have read in 2017 have taught me a lot.

**I plan to read at least 10 pages a day from any book I like** 

I know that my goals for the new year are not as fun as some of you might have expected but these are the things that I like doing.

**If you think your goals for the new year are awesome share them with me and everyone you know , maybe someone may get inspired from them and become a better person :D**
