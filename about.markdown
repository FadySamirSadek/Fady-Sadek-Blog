Hi! My name is Fady Samir Sadek!

>I like the way you work it ... No diggity, I got to bag it up

I am 19 years old. I am currently in my second year @ Nile university majoring in Computer science.

I love Javascript , I can not say i am good at it but I can definitely say I enjoy working with it.

Currently I am studying reactjs and trying to become a better javascript developer by doing some wired activities in my free time , to mention a few I am trying to finish reading the Ecma Script Specification.

I am going to mainly blog about the stuff that I find intresting or the stuff that I think will benefit other people. Also I am currently working full time in a software development house , I work mainly with stuff like angular 4 , sass , less so I am going to blog also about the intresting stuff I learn in my day job working on cool stuff or from my awesome collegues.
